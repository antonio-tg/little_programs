# Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

# Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.

def decoder(n):
    return n


n = input('Enter a number to convert to Roman: ')

m = decoder(n)

print(f'The number {n} in roman is {m}')
